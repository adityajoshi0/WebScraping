# WebScraping
# 📈 Stock Data Extraction and Visualization Project

This repository contains three Jupyter Notebooks focused on extracting and visualizing stock market data using different methods in Python. It serves as a hands-on project for learning and applying data science skills such as data extraction, web scraping, data cleaning, and data visualization.

## 🔍 Project Overview

### 1. Extracting and Visualizing Stock Data (`ExtractingAndVisualizingStockData.ipynb`)
- Uses Yahoo Finance data via `yfinance` to extract historical stock data.
- Includes interactive visualizations using Plotly.
- Demonstrates how to load, process, and display time series data.

### 2. Extracting Stock Data Using a Python Library (`ExtractingStockDataUsingaPythonLibrary.ipynb`)
- Uses the `yfinance` library to extract stock data (e.g., Tesla and GameStop).
- Demonstrates basic financial data extraction and DataFrame manipulation using `pandas`.

### 3. Extracting Stock Data via Web Scraping (`ExtractingStockDataWebScraping.ipynb`)
- Scrapes revenue data directly from websites (e.g., Macrotrends) using `BeautifulSoup` and `requests`.
- Cleans and formats raw HTML data into structured DataFrames.
- Focuses on string manipulation and parsing real-world HTML content.
